title:An explanation on recent events.;
description:
	{zws}	Here{get;~a}s an explanation of the recent events in the server, and a quick rundown of all the events. Just note that any further questions should be taken into DMs as the explanation is here.
	{zws};
fields.name:Fossil got trialed very abruptly by Crisis.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	Without discussion about it with the moderator/administrator team. Crisis{get;~a} only reasoning for this was that he was one of the most active people in VC. I immediately thought this was a bad decision, not because I personally have nothing against Fossil, but because in my eyes he didn{get;~a}t fit the standard of a person that should be taken as an example. Fossil did somewhat fine during his trial period, however one thing stood out.
	{zws};
	
fields.name:He was easily biased towards his closer friends.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	Quickly bandwagoning with things his friends were doing, despite some of the things being against the rules. There is a likely case that if this was any other person doing it, Fossil would have pointed out their mistakes, but he didn{get;~a}t when it came to his friends.
	{zws};

fields.name:To not beat around the bush, it was immediately apparent that Fossil{get;~a}s delivery when it came to discussion was not what a moderator should have.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	A few times Fossil was caught circle jerking an issue, starting shit (likely not on purpose, however you should know that if you hold power, people will quickly take your side, that{get;~a}s just how people work). Biggest part of this was straight up bullying of Kao.

	I shouldn{get;~a}t have to say this, but. Kao made a mistake, all of this was discussed internally with Admins and changes were made, but bullying a kid for a mistake he{get;~a}s improving from, is probably worse than making that mistake in the first place. Even when straight up told to stop, things continued.
	{zws};

fields.name:When called out on things, he was very aggressive in his arguments.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	Even when discussing things with Admins (Who are, by the way, his superior).
	
	His default argument to this was: {get;~q}Just because they are higher up than me, doesn{get;~a}t mean I have to blindly follow them{get;~q} This is absolutely correct, hell, we encourage internal discussion if people don{get;~a}t agree with something an admin has done, but this wasn{get;~a}t just about {get;~q}blindly following{get;~q} said Admins.
	{zws};

fields.name:Conversations in the Mod chat are supposed to stay THERE.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	This has been said multiple times in the channel itself, however. On a few occasions this was not the case. I{get;~a}ll have to take a slight detour to actually explain this correctly, so bear with me.

	Kao gave a friend of his access to his alt account (Alice) during the ERP incident, (So he didn{get;~a}t actually try to defend himself by saying someone took hold of his own account when the incident happened, which was reported on Crisis Notification) however, __none of this was publicly discussed__, and only discussed in the Mod only chat, then how did this get into Crisis Notification?
	{zws};

fields.name:Crisis gave Fossil a solid 3 days to try and better his behavior.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	And especially to try and better his delivery in terms of conversation and discussion. During the end if this period, more drama happened regarding Nimda{get;~a}s place in the administration team.

	Fossil came out of the blue just saying:
		*{get;~q}Then why don{get;~a}t you do your job?{get;~q}*
		*{get;~q}???{get;~q}*
		**\[[Source](https://pantsu.review/4b61e8.png)\]**
	{zws};

fields.name:Majority of Nimda{get;~a}s job in the administration happens internally.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	This should have never been brought up publicly anyway, if someone was concerned with his position in the moderation team, he should do it in DM{get;~a}s, or Mod channels.
	
	It was also delivered with hostility, something that Crisis asked Fossil to improve on.
	{zws};

fields.name:Him failing that part was the final shot and is what led Fossil to be demodded.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	Apart from all this, Crisis was sick of waking up to 15 notifications complaining about something that {get;~q}had happened again{get;~q}, so action was taken. 

	I hope this was enough information on the whole matter, this won{get;~a}t be discussed publicly in the server anymore, and anyone who does try to circle jerk this whole shabbang can be immediately warned.
	
	And on final note, "Your position may also be removed without warning or reason if deemed fit by the current owner and designated co-owner." This was taken directly from the moderator [Code of Conduct](https://catgirls.should-be.legal/f025b0.png), which Fossil and all of the staff agreed to upon joining the moderation team.
	
	I{get;~a}d like to end this off by reposting what I said about Kao{get;~a}s situation earlier, as I{get;~a}m sure some of you will comment: {get;~q}Why is Kao still admin then.{get;~q} Note that I’m just relaying info here and __I’m not picking fucking sides.__
	{zws};
	
fields.name:When the whole Kao incident happened, we had a 3 fucking hour discussion about it, and CHANGES. WERE. MADE.;
fields.value:		
	{zws}	He got a giant warning, and since then he{get;~a}s been improving, I understand that you guys might still have feelings and opinions about it all, but keep them to yourself because this decision has been made.
	{zws};

fields.name:Keep note that Kao is on his last leg;
fields.value:
	{zws}	If you find him, or any staff member legitimately abusing the Code of Conduct, or Standard Server Rules, let me, Doggo, or Crisis know.
	Obviously false accusations (which, looking at the chat right now are gonna happen) will not be seriously considered.;

title:An explanation on recent events.;
description:
	{zws}	Here{get;~a}s an explanation of the recent events in the server, and a quick rundown of all the events. Just note that any further questions should be taken into DMs as the explanation is here.
	{zws};
fields.name:It started when Fossil got trialed very abruptly, without the discussion most staff goes through.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	When moderators are selected from applications, their ability as staff is usually tossed around with current staff for at least 15-30 minutes before the ultimate decision is made.
	
	Due to Fossil{get;~a}s high activity, I thought he was a good pick and threw his name out to the team. Most people generally agreed that it would be a good idea to wait, but I moved ahead with the choice regardless. Fossil did well through the trial process as a whole, and was fully staffed later in the week with a few others.
	
	__But why were his moderator permissions revoked?__
	{zws};
	
fields.name:Primarily, his delivery.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	People who question my actions are very important to me. They{get;~a}re necessary to help me improve as an owner of the server, and as someone who upholds the server rules. I also feel like that should hold true for all of my staff, and how we aim to give everyone our best. But Fossil{get;~a}s approaches left something to be desired, primarily hurting morale rather than delivering helpful criticisms. 
	
	I know this was not his intention, so I discussed it with him in chat. However, after two days, I continued to receive reports of similar issues. As much as we love internal discussion, it continued to feel less like discussion. [For a quick example, this is a small crop taken from when he trying to verify the work one of our admins do.](https://pantsu.review/4b61e8.png) Again, the issue here is not the questioning itself, but the *DELIVERY*.
	{zws};

fields.name:Secondarily, his approach on the issues with Kao.;
fields.value:
	{zws}	Now this topic itself has been beaten into the ground already, and will even be discussed later in this blurb. But after the major events ensued, Kao and Fossil escalated an already heated debate in the general chat. 
	
	This sparked me to announce to all staff, those two especially, that issues within the staff should be debated in the moderator only chat from that moment onward. However, Fossil still continued later, resulting in a violation of the Code of Conduct, section 8.

	{get;~q}8. Listen to your peers and superiors. With a large staff, differing opinions are inevitable. Debates and discussions keep us on our toes and thinking properly.{get;~q} ***__However, when a higher-up tells you to stop, you should stop.__*** While explaining your actions and discussing the issue is encouraged, failure to follow orders will result in a punishment.
	{zws};

fields.name:{zws};
fields.value:
	***```prolog{newline}THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AT LENGTH, MANY TIMES OVER, AND THIS POST IS THE CONSENSUS THAT ALL INVOLVED PARTIES HAVE REACHED AND AGREED ON TOGETHER. (THEREFORE, IT ISN’T ANYBODY’S BUSINESS ANYMORE) I WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE THE BEGINNING AND END TO ANY FUTURE DISCUSSIONS OF THE TOPICS OR QUESTIONS LISTED, AS THE SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AD NAUSEUM, AND THE DRAMA STEMMED FROM THEM IS OVERWHELMINGLY REDUNDANT. IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON. ANYONE CAUGHT TRYING TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION BEYOND THIS INFORMATION BLURB WILL BE WARNED. ANYONE TRYING TO FAN ARGUMENTS WILL BE KICKED, OR EVEN BANNED WITHOUT A CHANCE FOR APPEAL.```***{newline;3}***__QUESTIONS:__***;

fields.name:1. Why start with Fossil?;
fields.value:
	{zws}	When the Moderator Code of Conduct was rewritten to be almost double the size it was before, I concluded that would be the point where I start standing my ground and holding my staff accountable for their actions beyond that point.
	{zws};

fields.name:2. Why not include Kao?;
fields.value:
	{zws}	Again, beyond that point. We rewrote the Code of Conduct after the issues occurred, and we decided that to hold people accountable beyond the point where the new CoC was submitted.
	{zws};

fields.name:3. Is Kao beyond punishment?;
fields.value:
	{zws}	__Absolutely not__. After a three hour discussion, we concluded that Kao showed us we had very little to stand on when it came to punishing staff. As such, he contributed to the rewrite and given the opportunity to improve, and he has.
	
	His number of warns decreased, he{get;~a}s a lot more lenient, and he appears to have matured. We{get;~a}ve all moved on with it, and you should too. And if you ever see him breaking the CoC explicitly, or any staff for that matter, immediately contact Jodi, myself, or (in worst case situations only) Xyaro. False accusations may result in a punishment of the accuser.
	{zws};

fields.name:4. Will Fossil get that opportunity to improve?;
fields.value:
	{zws}	He did. I went into a deep discussion with him in our DM{get;~a}s, pointing out the two major issues listed above, putting special emphasis on the above. After a full three days passed with no report, I would have happily wiped the slate clean. Unfortunately, only two days had passed, and I was ready to take some action.
	{zws};
	
fields.name:5. Isn{get;~a}t it hypocritical for you to point out calling out someone in general chat when you did it yourself?;
fields.value:		
	{zws}	Absolutely. When the time came, instead of handling the situation in a mature manner, I foolishly did the opposite, and did the same thing I was criticising him for. That was absolutely unacceptable, and I am filled with regret for doing it. I{get;~a}m sorry, Fossil. ;
